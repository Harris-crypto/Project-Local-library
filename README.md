The first project that we worked on during the Thinkful course. Here we created an app that catalogs the status of all of the documented books in a local library by utilizing new-found skills such as implementation of the Filter, Map, Find, and Reduce methods as well as creating arrow functions. In addition to that list, we also used ternary operators, spread operators, object shorthand, array/object destructuring, and for/in loops along with helper functions.
